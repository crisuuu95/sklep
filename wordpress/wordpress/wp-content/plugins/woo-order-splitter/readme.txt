A great plugin to split WooCommerce orders. You can duplicate orders as well.

== Description ==

WooCommerce is an awesome eCommerce plugin that allows you to sell anything and if you want to sell products that are not on stock yet, but you're sure that you'll have them soon in stock again? So Woo Order Splitter is a solution for you as you can create a rule for those items. All of the upcoming items can go in a separate orders section/status. It enables you to split, consolidate, clone, your crowd/combined/bulk orders using intelligent rules.

After activation there will  be a Split icon in wp-admin > WooCommerce > orders list page within the order actions. Splits all order Meta data and product data across into the new order ID. Order is created and a note is left in the new order of the older order ID for future reference. Order status is then set on hold awaiting admin to confirm payment.
